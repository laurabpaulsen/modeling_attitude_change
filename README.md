# modeling_attitude_change
Portfolio 3 for the course Advanced Cognitive Modeling (S2024) from study group 1. 

The code in this repository holds code for model comparion between a simple bayes and a weighted bayes approach to analyse how the opinion of an individual changes implicitly after being informed about the group-level opinion.

The data from the project comes from the *Socially Learned Attitude Change is not reduced in Medicated Patients with Schizophrenia* paper by Simonsen et al. (2019).
